# Hey there! 👋

I'm a software engineer and tutor with 8+ years of web and mobile development experience. I primarily write code in Python, TypeScript, and Go, and recently started learning Java, developing full-stack apps and data science pipelines. I also train people and provide AI annotated data to train it how to code in Python, Typescript, and Go 🧠.

I'm a Master of Science in Information Technology postgraduate at the University of the People (MS IT @ UoPeople) 📚.

Once I graduate, I'd like to be a Master of Science in Computer Science postgraduate with a Specialization in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology (MS CS, ML @ Georgia Tech) ✨.

When I'm not coding or studying, I spend most of my free time in introspection 🧘, cooking 🍳, and listening to a ton of music 🎧.

Ultimately, I'm pursuing MS degrees in both IT and CS because 1️⃣ UoPeople and Georgia Tech have the most affordable and highly accredited graduate degree programs (as far as I know), and 2️⃣ I believe this is *the* time to upskill for the AI revolution 🤖.
