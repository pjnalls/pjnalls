# Hey there! 👋

I'm a Master of Science in Information Technology postgraduate at the University of the People (MS in IT @ UoPeople) 📚.
 
Once I graduate, I'd like to be a Master of Science in Computer Science postgraduate with a Specialization in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology (MS in CS, ML @ Georgia Tech) ✨.

I'm also a software engineer with 8+ years of frontend development experience and a tutor by profession. I primarily write code in React Native, NativeWind, and TypeScript, building and teaching people and AI how to build cross-platform Expo apps for iOS, Android, and the Web. I also develop machine learning models with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Python 🧠.

When I'm not studying or coding, I spend most of my free time in introspection 🧘, cooking 🍳, and listening to a ton of video game music 👾.

Ultimately, I'm pursuing MS degrees in both IT and CS because 1️⃣ UoPeople and Georgia Tech have the most affordable graduate degree programs (as far as I know), and 2️⃣ I believe this is *the* time to upskill for the AI revolution 🤖.
